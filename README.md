FAQ:
  1.  Q: Why a Mega class? this is C#!

      A: Having mutiplle C# files for every feature can be annoying or even daunting for beginners. It certaintly comes with it's own downfalls, but I like to think the pros out weight the cons.
      
  2.  Q: 3rd person animations when?
 
      A: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'm not an animator, I did try though.
      
All textures, 3D models and Code were created by me (as of 08/30/2021), Consider supporting me by buying me Kofi! https://ko-fi.com/aedangraves
