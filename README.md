# SUPERFirstPerson
A First person AIO controller script for the Unity game engine.

Unity Version 2020.3.7f

This is an open source project that aims to be robust and easy to use for beginners to the Unity Engine.

Current Feature set:
  - 1st and 3rd person perspectives
  - Mesh and Terrain navigation
  - Survival Stats
  - Material/Terrain layer based dynamic footstep sound effects
  - Vault and Slide movements
  - Headbob camera animations
  - and of course all bundled in one single script!

I encourage contributions! I'm currently working a 9-5 and this particular project gets me pretty burnt out pretty quickly. Below is a to do list, feel free to cross one off for us! Contributors will be credited!

  5. Better Implementation of the new Input system
  6. Camera animations for vaulting (written in code alongside headbobing)
  7. Better Demo Scene

FAQ:
  1.  Q: Why a Mega class? this is C#!

      A: Having multiple C# files/Components across the settup can be annoying or even daunting for beginners. It certainly comes with it's own downfalls, but I like to think the pros out weight the cons.
      
  2.  Q: 3rd person animations when?
 
      A: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'm not an animator, I did try though.
